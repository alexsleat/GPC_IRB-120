This is the python client, altered for ROS.

What it should do:

It should subscribe to a string and a flag.
	the flag should be set when the string has been passed to this node
	the flag should reset once the client has sent the string over the socket
It should publish the ack
	when the socket returns an acknoledgement it should publish this
It should publish any other data passed back to it.
